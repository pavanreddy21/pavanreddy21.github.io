  ➔ Successfully developed a custom KNN ensemble model that improved the accuracy of healthcare predictions by around 15%.
  ➔ Implemented techniques such as parallelization to reduce the training time of the model by almost 96%, resulting in a significant decrease in time taken for training. Now it is 1/27th of the total time taken previously while preserving the accuracy of predictions.
  ➔ Developed interpretable machine learning models that aid medical decision-making and currently trying to improve their interpretability.
